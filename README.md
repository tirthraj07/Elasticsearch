## What is Elastic Stack

The Elastic Stack is a group of open source products built by `Elastic`
The stack includes : `Elastic Search`, `Kibana`, `Logstash`, `Beats`, `X-Pack`

## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, scalable data store, and vector database built on Apache Lucene.
It's optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Use Elasticsearch to search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes in near real time.
It is an open source analytics and full text search engine

## Use Cases

- **Full-text search**: Build a fast, relevant full-text search solution using inverted indexes, tokenization, and text analysis.
- **Vector database**: Store and search vectorized data, and create vector embeddings with built-in and third-party natural language processing (NLP) models.
- **Semantic search**: Understand the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries using tools like synonyms, dense vector embeddings, and learned sparse query-document expansion.
- **Hybrid search**: Combine full-text search with vector search using state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.
- **Build search experiences**: Add hybrid search capabilities to apps or websites, or build enterprise search engines over your organizationâ€™s internal data sources.
- **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**: Use Elasticsearch as a retrieval engine to supplement generative AI models with more relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary data for a range of use cases.
- **Geospatial search**: Search for locations and calculate spatial relationships using geospatial queries.

## What is Kibana

It is a dashboard used for analyzing and visualizing data in Elastic Search

## What is Logstash

It processes logs from application and sends them to elastic search. It is a free and open server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multitude of sources, transforms it and sends it to your favorite `stash` (kafka/elasticsearch)

Example:  
new line log file event -> Logstash -> Kafka/Elasticsearch

## What is X-Pack

Adds additional features to the Elasticsearch & Kibana

1. Security : Adds authentication and authorization
2. Monitors the performance of elastic stack and gets notified
3. Enables machine learning on Kibana and elasticsearch
4. Graph : Analyze relationship / relevance in data useful for recommendation. It exposes an API that we can integrate in our applications
5. Elasticsearch SQL -> SQL API (SQL Query to Result) and Translate API (SQL Query to Query Domain Specific Language)

## What is Beats

Beats is a collection of data shippers. They are light weight agents which send data from hundreds or thousands of machines and systems to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

## Installation Guide

Install Elastic Search With Docker - [Click Here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)

1. Create a new docker network

```bash
docker network create elastic
```

2. Pull the Elasticsearch Docker image

```bash
docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.0
```

3. Start an Elasticsearch container.

```bash
docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -it -m 1GB docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.0
```

Machine learning features such as semantic search with ELSER require a larger container with more than 1GB of memory. If you intend to use the machine learning capabilities then start with

```bash
docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -it -m 6GB -e "xpack.ml.use_auto_machine_memory_percent=true" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.17.0
```

4. Copy the generated elastic password and enrollment token

```bash
docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
docker exec -it es01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
```

5. Copy the SSL Certificate from container to local machine

```bash
docker cp es01:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/http_ca.crt .
```
